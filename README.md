# BIZHAWK_NEAT_EVOLUTION
Implementation of the NEAT evolution algorithm, inspired by SethBling.
I saw some places that it could be improved upon slightly.

# How to use
To use this, place a copy of the lua script in BizHawk's lua folder, and also include a copy of your save state. This is called DP1.state in the lua file, so name your save state DP1.state

Simply open Bizhawk, and load the lua script. I wrote this script for super mario world on the SNES.
